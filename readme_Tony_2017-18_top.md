# UK General Election after 2018 border change using 2017 votes and Tony's Top Up System

Over at {http://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/boundaries2018.html| Electoral Calculus)
they have modelled the 2017 election results using the new proposed seats from the 2018 Boundary Reviews. 

So far these changes seem to renforce the issues with FPTP reducing the spectrum of MPs.

Tony Kennick suggested that we should see if returning to the 650 MPs we currently have using a top-up list to fill those 50 seats.

The D'Hondt algorithm was tweaked to start from the projected FPTP results based on the UK General Election Results June 2017.

I have done this based both on topping up each region speratly (the top up seat where destributed based on the proportion of 2018 seats), and at a National Level (Tony_TopUp_2017-18.js)
